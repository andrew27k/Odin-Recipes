        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 1/2 pound) boneless beef chuck roast, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oi</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>2 cups Merlot wine</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 carrots, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Generously season beef with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat. Cook and stir beef in hot oil until browned on all sides, 10 to 15 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer meat to a plate.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir onion, butter, and a pinch of salt in drippings in the Dutch oven until onion begins to sweat. Stir in flour; cook and stir until onion starts to soften, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour in wine; bring to a simmer and cook until wine is reduced by half, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Return beef and any accumulated juices to the Dutch oven. Add broth, carrots, celery, thyme sprigs, and bay leaf; season with salt. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot with a lid, and cook over low heat until meat is almost tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the lid and continue cooking at a simmer until meat is tender and stew is thick, about 30 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
